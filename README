Requirements
============

- recent perl version
- Text::CSV_XS
- Date::Parse

Usage
=====

Edit the script to change the accounts:

my $netacc='Assets:Current Assets:Paypal';
my $grossacc='Income:Paypal-import';
my $feeacc='Expenses:Fees:Paypal';

Run the script:

perl gnupal.pl < Downloaded.csv > paypal.qif

The script will:

- book the gross total of the transaction in $grossacc
- book the paypal transaction fee in $feeacc
- book the net total (gross minus fee) in $netacc

After importing in GNUCash you must manually move the split transactions
from the account defined in $grossacc to the right income and expense
accounts.
